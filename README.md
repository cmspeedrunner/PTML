# PTML
PTML (Python Text Markup Language) is a Python flavored markup language that is exactly like python, but in the style of markup language, it has no use cases as the syntax is weird and annoying, it is a joke. It is a derivitive of python, a distrobution, that is made within python. 

### Syntax
#### Your first PTML program
To simply print hello world you just do `<print>"Hello, World!"</print>`<br>
but this is not a program? Well it is, but a small one at that, what about an echo loop in PTML? Well it is pretty simple, you can do:<br>
`<while>True</while>
   echo = <input>"ECHO>>>"</input>
   <print>echo</print>`<br>
But, you can also use the inbuilt `<loop>` keyword to create it like this:<br>
`<loop>
   echo = <input>"ECHO>>>"</input>
   <print>echo</print>`
